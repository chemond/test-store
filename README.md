## About

The Test Store is exactly what it say's it is, a test ecommerce store. This website was created to test out implementing SnipCart into a basic HTML and CSS website. 

It proved to be extremely simple, however it is very apparent that a CMS is wise if a website has more than a handful of products that need to be available for purchase.
